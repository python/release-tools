# Windows Releases

This build script is used for official releases of CPython on Windows.
It is somewhat more complex than `Tools/msi/buildrelease.bat` because it uses additional parallelism
and uses our official code signing certificate.

This script is designed to be run on Azure Pipelines.
Information about the syntax can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/

The current deployment is at https://dev.azure.com/Python/cpython/_build?definitionId=21
Chances are you don't have permission to do anything other than view builds. Access is controlled by the release team.

If you do have permission, you can launch a release build by selecting **Run pipeline**,
specify the desired **Git remote** and **Git tag**, enable **Publish release**,
toggle any version specific options, and click **Run**.

The version specific options are required due to changes in our build that require modifications
to the publish pipeline. For example, whether to publish ARM64 binaries.

When signing is enabled (any value besides "Unsigned"), authorised approvers will be notified and
will need to approve each stage that requires the signing certificate (typically three).
This helps prevent "surprise" builds from using the official certificate.

The code signing certificate is stored in Azure Key Vault, and is authenticated using the
variables in a Variable group called CPythonSign. The variable group is what triggers approvals.
The group is at https://dev.azure.com/Python/cpython/_library?itemType=VariableGroups&view=VariableGroupView&variableGroupId=1&path=CPythonSign

To upload a new code signing certificate (which will be provided by the PSF),
or to change to a new Azure Keyvault instance,
see the documentation at https://github.com/vcsjones/AzureSignTool/blob/main/WALKTHROUGH.md.

GPG signature generation uses a GPG key stored in the Secure Files library.
This can be found at https://dev.azure.com/Python/cpython/_library?itemType=SecureFiles
Regardless of who triggers the build, the signatures will be attributed to whoever's key is used.
The passphrase for the key is a secure build variable,
and can be modified by editing the build definition and selecting **Variables**.
(TODO: Move the passphrase and reference to the file into the CPythonSign variable group.)

(Further documentation to be added as we find out what ought to be documented.)
